Tetris with Python and Tkinter
==============================

(24 July 2011) I just finished Tetris :-). I'll write up docs and have ways to
run it on your platform pretty soon.

This is Tetris in Python and Tkinter. The specs are pretty
loose. It's more or less based on my memories of playing Tetris in various
places over the years. The colors of the shapes come from the Wikipedia 
[Tetris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris) article.
