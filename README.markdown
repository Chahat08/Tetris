Tetris with Python and Tkinter
==============================

Tetris is not yet finished. Right now it's just falling blocks.

This is an attempt to write Tetris in Python and Tkinter. The specs are pretty
loose. It's more or less based on my memories of playing Tetris in various
places over the years. The colors of the shapes come from the Wikipedia [Tetris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris) article.
